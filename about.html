<h1>About Evan</h1>
<p>
I'm a software engineer and cartoonist located in Denver, Colorado. I earned my B.S. in Computer Science in June of 2018. I'm currently working as a Software Development Engineer at Charles Schwab. If you are here, I'm assuming you want to learn more "about me". For that reason, I'll take the liberty of trying to tell a full story below.
</p>

<h2>The Story</h2>
<p>
I grew up in Albuquerque, New Mexico (I was in high school during the time that Breaking Bad was released). I was an arts and humanities geek. To give you an idea, I medaled on the National Latin Exam, I was president of the Spanish Honors Society, and my first job was stacking books at the public library. I also loved drawing cartoons and I tried to create a graphic novel for my senior project.
</p>
<p>
When I left Albuquerque, I knew I wanted to continue my interdisciplinary scholarship at a liberal arts college. I also knew I wanted to learn some practical skills, and hopefully keep drawing pictures. I enrolled at the University of Denver in 2014 pursuing an animation/game degree. I started a comic strip for the student newspaper, <a href="https://duclarion.com/"><i>The Clarion</i></a>, that year, and also took my first programming class.
</p>
<p>
I really liked working on computer programs. I was good at problem-solving and I loved the challenge. In my second year, I started working outside of school in an after-school program teaching elementary students coding. I would stick with that job through graduation. Programming was my new vice. I shirked a lot of the art requirements for my animation/game degree so I could take more computer science classes.
</p>
<p>
In my third year, I studied abroad in Barcelona. I created a <a href="https://diadotgram.wordpress.com/">cartoon blog</a> for my University's study abroad program about my time there. During that time, I took it upon myself to learn some web development skills in hopes of landing an internship. That summer I interned with Vail Resorts in their digital retail group. I worked on a team with two other interns to create an internal tool for graphic designers and developers to manage SCSS style definitions for ski resort applications.

<p>
While registering for my classes in the first semester of my fourth year, my advisor informed me I couldn't take any more C.S. classes without exceeding the limit for my B.A. degree. I was really hoping to take some higher-level courses like parallel/distributed computing and programming languages. When I asked him if there was anything I could do, he informed me that the only things standing between me and a B.S. in C.S. were some C.S. coursework and about a year of Calculus. I did a year of Calculus and now I'm a "computer scientist".

I graduated from DU in June of 2018 and went to work for Charles Schwab. I'm a developer on a team that works on cloud microservices to support some business functions like billing, offer management, and reporting for an <a href="https://intelligent.schwab.com/">automated investing product</a> (RoboAdvisor). As a developer for a financial services firm, I've been called upon to learn more about web application security, and am planning to pursue my CSSLP in 2021.

<h2>About This Site</h2>

<p>
This site exists to showcase some of my work and as a platform for publishing content on the things that have me most excited about programming at the moment (like software engineering, distributed systems, programming languages, and security). It's also an excuse to keep drawing cartoons. Thanks for visiting!
