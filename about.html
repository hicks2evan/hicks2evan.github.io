<h1>About Evan</h1>
<br>
<p>
I'm a software engineer and cartoonist located in Denver, Colorado.
</p>
<p>
I graduated from the University of Denver in 2018 with my B.S. in Computer Science. I've been working as a developer in Denver ever since.

You can check out some of my old cartoon work on <a href="https://diadotgram.wordpress.com/">diadotgram</a>. I made those posts while studying abroad in Barcelona.
