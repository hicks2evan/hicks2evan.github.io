<h1>About Evan</h1>
<br>
<p>
I'm a software engineer and cartoonist located in Denver, Colorado.
</p>
<p>
I earned my B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Denver in 2018. I've been working as a developer in Denver since then. 
I'm interested in software development operations, data analytics, and programming languages.
</p> 
<p>
I aspire to be a lifelong learner. Right now I mostly work in Java, C#, and Javascript, but I'm working on my own to get handy with Python. 
This site was created in 2020 to showcase my work and serve as a platform for sharing new content.
